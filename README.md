# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills along with logical problem-solving and game flow control using JavaScript.

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. One player uses the symbol "X" and the other uses "O". Players take turns selecting empty cells on the grid with the objective of placing three identical symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.

The game begins with Player X. After every move, the program checks all possible winning combinations dynamically. If a player successfully aligns three of their symbols in any valid pattern, the game declares that player as the winner. If all cells are filled without satisfying any winning condition, the game ends in a draw.

The application includes a reset functionality that allows players to restart the game without refreshing the page. The user interface is designed to be simple, clean, and responsive to provide a smooth user experience.

Key Features:
- Two-player turn-based gameplay
- Automatic win detection
- Draw condition handling
- Game reset option
- Interactive and responsive design

Concepts Used:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Conditional statements
- Arrays for storing winning patterns
- Control flow logic

Technologies Used:
- HTML for structuring the layout
- CSS for styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript for implementing game logic and interactivity

This project strengthens understanding of how front-end technologies work together to build interactive web applications and helps improve logical thinking by translating real-world game rules into executable code.
